# Hospital-Database-System-with-Interactive-Dashboard-Oracle-APEX-SQL
This project involves the design and implementation of a scalable hospital database system using Oracle APEX, with SQL used for database creation and data management. The system includes an interactive dashboard providing real-time insights into hospital operations, such as patient distribution and doctor availability, enhancing resource management and decision-making for hospital administration. The project was originally developed as part of a group academic assignment, and the dashboard was built using Oracle APEX's back-end SQL functionality to support data-driven decision-making.

Due to the discontinuation of Oracle APEX access, this repository includes SQL scripts for creating the database, screenshots of the SQL code used for generating various reports, and visualizations from the dashboard.
